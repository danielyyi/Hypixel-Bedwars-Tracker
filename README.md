# Hypixel Bedwars Stat Tracker Website

Here's the website: https://bedwarstats.com. 
If you want to test it out but don't know a Minecraft username, try 'Dream'. He's a popular YouTuber.

**If website not working, then that means my minecraft api key expired. I try to refresh it periodically but I am working on other things so it may take a while

A website where Hypixel Bedwars players can view their stats through gamemode specific cards and informational graphs. Made with React.js, Chart.js, HTML, and CSS.

This is the first time I learned and worked with React Router and React.js in general. I learned how to use React Hooks as well as use an API key to get information from an API (in this case it was [Hypixel's Public API](https://api.hypixel.net/), [PlayerDB](https://playerdb.co/), and [Craftatar](https://crafatar.com/)). I also like to think I got a bit better with my HTML and CSS Responsive layout skills, however I'm aware that they still need losts of work. This was also the first time I used Chart.js and fortunately the [documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/) was super helpful. Additionally, I used Netlify for deployment and also used Netlify lambda functions in order to hide my API key. I also think I could have made the code more efficient (especially the way I assigned API data to arrays) so maybe I'll come back and clean up the code once I become more skilled in React.js and Javascript and programming in general. 

(to update API key, just change the env in Netlify)
